      <h3>Down the rabbit hole challenge</h3>
      <p>
        There are 100 holes, all in a row, and a long tunnel connecting them. <br />
        A rabbit lives down there, and you're trying to catch him. <br />The rabbit starts down 1 one of the holes, but you don't know which. Every time you look down into a hole the rabbit moves. But he only moves one hole â€” either left or right. <br />
        <strong>How can you find the rabbit? <br />And how long will it take?</strong>
      </p>
